# Thesis
The recent crises that hit the world economy have emphasized the need to develop models capable of
predicting these events and their effects on all actors in the system. A particularly important sector
in the outbreak of a crisis is the banking sector, from which financial instability often originates and
grows, then spreads to the entire economic system through a domino effect. This thesis analyses
the systemic risk of the European banking sector between 2021 and 2023, through CDS spreads. To
estimate the evolution of the risk during the two-year period, Bayesian Networks were implemented,
thanks to which the probabilities that a bank will go through a period of stress conditioned by the
stress of another bank were inferred. The results show a sharp increase in February 2022, when
Russia started the invasion of Ukraine. After about four or five months, the level returned to the
one before the outbreak of the crisis. According to this analysis, the banks most responsible for the
propagation of the stress were BNP Paribas and Danske Bank A S. Moreover different robustness
checks with rolling window or splitted data were provided.
